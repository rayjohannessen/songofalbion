7/16/2010
---------
Battle Changes
	- The attacking unit is required to actually move to the defender's tile (requiring stamina to move)
	- Attacker moves halfway onto defender's tile, attacks, and stays until moved out, killed, or enemy is killed

---------
Battle tweaks
	- Units now face each other (EAST/WEST only) during combat, the defender steps back and the attacker stands on 		the same tile opposite him.
