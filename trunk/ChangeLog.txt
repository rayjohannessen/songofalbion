7/14/2010
---------
Implemented pathfinding
	- Units may be moved by right-mouse or keyboard(only 1 space w/KB, so no real pathfinding done here)
	- Unit movement requires adequate stamina
	- Unit's may attack a unit at end of move, the path is determined and traversed by pathfinding


7/16/2010
---------
Battle Changes
	- The attacking unit is required to actually move to the defender's tile (requiring stamina to move)
	- Attacker moves halfway onto defender's tile, attacks, and stays until moved out, killed, or enemy is killed
	- If attacker wins and is not in the center of the tile, it moves to the center after enemy disappears


7/17/2010
---------

	- Free counter attacks keep track of times used during a battle (can't be used infinitely now)
	- Unit correctly pathfinds when an enemy target is selected and player moves to an open tile


7/19/2010
---------
Battle tweaks
	- Units now face each other (EAST/WEST only) during combat, the defender steps back and the attacker stands on 		the same tile opposite him.
	- bug fixed where you could right-click on the currently selected unit and stamina would be used as if moving, 		but nothing would happen
